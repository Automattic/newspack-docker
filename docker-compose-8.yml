  ## - The container wordpress is a very basic but custom container with WordPress and all of the tools we need
  ##   for development.
  ## - The container will be named jetpack_wordpress for easy reference when running docker/docker-compose commands
  ##
  ## Here we map the following:
  ##  - The docker/wordpress-develop directory where we'll get WordPress source code with unit tests
  ##  - The docker/wordpress directory so we can have WordPress source code modifiable from the host file system
  ##  - The docker/logs/apache2 directory so we can access Apache log files directly from the host file system
  ##  - The docker/logs/php directory so we can access PHP log files directly from the host file system
  ##  - The docker/bin directory for provisioning scripts
